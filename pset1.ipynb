Just download the notebook file (a `.ipynb` file) by clicking the download icon at the upper right, then drag it onto the JuliaBox dashboard to upload it there.

    "In linear algebra, it is critically important to **think about the shapes** (size) of matrices and vectors, and whether operations make sense.   You can multiply $AB$ if $A$ is $m \\times n$ ($m$ rows and $n$ columns) and $B$ is $n \\times p$ — the \"middle\" dimensions need to match up.  You can also add matrices of *equal* sizes, or multiply them by scalars.  Multiplying $Ax$, an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ by an $n$-component vector, can be thought of as a special case of this rule if you think of $x$ as an $n \\times 1$ \"matrix\".  On exams, it is common for people to panic and start writing down nonsense, and an easy way to catch this is to make sure that the operations you are writing down **have the correct shapes**.\n",
